Symfony Demo Application
========================

The goal here is to give u a basic summury example of what is possible with this framework

Requirements
------------

  * PHP 7.1.3 or higher;
  * PDO-SQLite PHP extension enabled;
  * and the [usual Symfony application requirements][2].

Usage
-----

<!-- There's no need to configure anything to run the application.  -->

If you have installed the [Symfony client][4] binary, run this command to run the built-in
web server and access the application in your browser at <http://localhost:8000>:

```bash
$ cd my_project/
$ symfony serve
```

If you don't have the Symfony client installed, run `php bin/console server:run`.
Alternatively, you can [configure a web server][3] like Nginx or Apache to run
the application.
